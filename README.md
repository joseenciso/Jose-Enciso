## First Mileston Project
## Personal Web Developer Website

### Sumary
The purpose of this project is to use all the knowledge gained creat a static website with from one to four pages.
This project is based on ***HTML*** to structure each page, ***CSS*** and ***BootStrap 4*** to style each element on the four pages. 

In the most of the cases CSS was implemented to style the HTML but in some other cases to access to BootStrap components and change the default aspect.

### Landing page
A breve introduction with some stylings.
Here is the home page of my project, which on the top will display a navegation bar big screen sizes and on mobile size will display the home link [jos.e.enciso](https://skrkrw.github.io/userCentricProjectOne/) which stands from my first and last names, Jos√© Enciso, with a little bit of creativity.

### Skills and Portfolio pages
Using the bootstrap cards structure, and customize them with HTML and CSS, to chage the order of the elements, size, etc.


### Contact Me
In the "contac me" page will find a a simple form  which all the components are manipulated to change the way they look like.

### The tools
Different tools were used throughout the development of this project.

* For version control, ***Git*** and ***GitHub*** were used. allowing to make changes and save them, if some of them were not the right change or did not fit with the new styling,or sometimes move through the history's branch.
In the end, GitHubDesktop was introduced to make easier the task of working with ***Git*** throw the command line, doing it with a visual application. 

    + Next, will show the commands used to during this project: 
     ```
     git config --global user.name "User Name" 
     git config --global user.email "User Email"

     git status
     git add .
     git commit -m "Comment"

     git push push origin master
     ```


* ***AWS*** and ***GitPod***, these are excelent **IDE** based ***online**, for some circumstances, this are not a suitable options.

* ***VS Code***, this software does not require internet conection to work, for this reason, and because sometimes there was no way to access to the internet or the speed was not fast enough, ***VS Code*** was used in most cases.
