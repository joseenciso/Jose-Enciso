## First Mileston Project
## Personal Web Developer Website

### Sumary
The purpose of this project is to use all the knowledge gained creat a static website with from one to four pages.
This project is based on ***HTML*** to structure each page, ***CSS*** and ***BootStrap 4*** to style each element on the four pages. 

In the most of the cases CSS was implemented to style the HTML but in some other cases to access to BootStrap components and change the default aspect.

### Landing page
A breve introduction with some stylings.
Here is the home page of my project, which on the top will display a navegation bar big screen sizes and on mobile size will display the home link [jos.e.enciso](https://skrkrw.github.io/userCentricProjectOne/) which stands from my first and last names, José Enciso, with a little bit of creativity.

### Skills and Portfolio pages
Using the bootstrap cards structure, and customize them with HTML and CSS, to chage the order of the elements, size, etc.
